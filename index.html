            <p> Hi, my name is Amanda Wessman, I'm from Utah. I love to play tennis and hang out with my family. I have a passion for traveling and being outside. 
                I love to hike, and go on bike rides with my family. I have four children. They are all boys. Kaden is 16, Landon is 14, Jaxon is 13 and Carson is 11. 
                We love to play tennis together, I coach the jr. High team that my youngest 3 kids all play on. I’m going back to school to get my bachelor’s degree. 
                I’m currently enrolled in the BYU worldwide program. I’m getting my degree in software development from BYU Idaho.  This webpage is for my WDD 130 Web Fundamentals class.
